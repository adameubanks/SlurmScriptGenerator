UVA Job Script Generator (Based on BYU Job Script Generator)
=====================

Generate batch job scripts for Slurm and PBS.

###[BYU Demo](https://byuhpc.github.io/BYUJobScriptGenerator/)

Code is licensed under the LGPL v3.  Enjoy.

It is quite likely that you will need to make modifications to the Javascript.  Different sites have very different ways of configuring scheduling systems, and this script reflects how UVA has set up its systems.  Attempts have been made to make the code flexible.  Several items have been added for demonstration purposes (feature and partition names, documentation links, etc.).
