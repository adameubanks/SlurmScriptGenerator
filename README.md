# UVA Slurm Script Generator
This repository provides a user-friendly interface for generating Slurm scripts specifically tailored for the University of Virginia's High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, Rivanna and Afton. Our tool simplifies the process of creating job scripts, making it accessible even for users who are new to Slurm and job scheduling on HPC systems.

## Live Demo
To see the tool in action, visit our live demo:

## About the Project
The **UVA Slurm Script Generator** is inspired by the [BYU Job Script Generator](https://rc.byu.edu/documentation/slurm/script-generator) and aims to provide a similar interface for the UVA community. By automating the script creation process, users can focus more on their computational tasks rather than the intricacies of Slurm scripting.

For those new to Slurm, it is a powerful and flexible job scheduler used by many HPC systems worldwide. It manages job queues, allocates resources, and ensures efficient execution of computational tasks.

To learn more about Slurm and how to use it effectively, check out the following resources:
